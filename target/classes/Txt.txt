Tetris
Tetris is a surprising game. On paper, at least, it seems unlikely that something so basic should
have done so well beyond the year 1975. Nevertheless, it’s been a consistently popular video
game for decades. It was invented in Russia, and it was never expected to be as popular as it
became. Yet, the reason it is so popular is that it meets the key criteria for fun in a game. That is,
it has goals, rules, feedback, participation is voluntary, and there are unnecessary obstacles that
keep the game challenging.
